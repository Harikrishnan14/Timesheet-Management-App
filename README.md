# Getting Started

This is a small Timesheet Management App built using Next.js and TypeScript.
Used packages such as Tailwind CSS for styling and NextAuth.js for authentication.

ðŸ•’ Time spent: Approximately 8 hours to build this app from scratch.

# Initial Setup:

1. **Install Node.js :** Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. You can download Node.js from the official website at https://nodejs.org/en/download/ or use your system's package manager.

   Check Node.js and npm Installation:
   Open a terminal ( or command prompt on Windows ) and run the following command to ensure Node.js is installed correctly:

   [ NOTE : npm comes with Node.js by default, you don't have to install it separately ]

2. **Clone or Download the Code :**

   Clone the repository using the following command:
   ### `git clone https://github.com/Harikrishnan14/Timesheet-Management-App.git`

   Then, navigate into the project folder:
   ### `cd Timesheet-Management-App`

   Or alternatively, download the ZIP file from GitHub and extract it.

5. **Install Dependencies :**
   1. Open the terminal ( or command prompt on Windows ) ( or if you are using VS Code, you can use its terminal ) from the root folder, run the following command to install all the dependencies needed to run the application [ Don't close this terminal we will be using this later] :
      ### `npm i`
      
# Starting the Application:

1. On the terminal which you used to install the dependencies for the application, run the following command to start the application :
   ### `npm run dev`
   
2. After this, Go to 'http://localhost:3000'
3. If you want to see the hosted website, Go to 'https://timesheet-management-app-hari14.vercel.app'

# Packages Used:

1.  **Next.js :** Framework for server-rendered React applications.Supports both static and server-side rendering out of the box.
2.  **TypeScript  :** Strongly typed superset of JavaScript. Helps catch errors at compile time and improves developer experience.
3. **Tailwind CSS :** Used for responsive design. It offers utility classes to quickly style elements without writing custom CSS from scratch. It's flexible and easy to customize.
4.  **NextAuth.js :** A complete authentication solution for Next.js applications. It supports multiple authentication providers (like Google, GitHub, Credentials, etc.), session handling, and secure login flows with minimal configuration. Ideal for handling user login, logout, and session management.
